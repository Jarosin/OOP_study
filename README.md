1) ducks - strategy design pattern - defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.
2) weather - observer pattern - defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically.
3) beverage - the decorator pattern - attaches additional
responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality.
4) Pizza(factory_method) - factory method pattern - defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.
