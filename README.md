1) ducks - strategy design pattern - defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from

2) weather - observer pattern - defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically.
